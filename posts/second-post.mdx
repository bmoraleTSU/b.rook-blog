# Our baby girl was born healthy and strong!

Earlier this year we welcomed our first child into our lives! We are so thankful and blessed that she was born without any 
complications and the birth went about as smoothly as I could have hoped for! We are excited to step into the new year and see
what suprises lay ahead. I hope everyone had a good 2022 holiday season and a safe New Years!
